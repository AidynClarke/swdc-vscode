## Getting started

**1. Create your web account**

<p align="center" style="margin: 0 10%">
  <img src="../swdc-vscode/images/login-prompt.png" alt="Code Time for VS Code login prompt" />
</p>

We strongly recommend that you create a web account at [app.software.com](https://app.software.com/) to fully unlock all of the features of Code Time. The web app has data visualizations and settings you can customize, such as your work hours and rates per project for advanced time tracking. You can also connect Google Calendar to visualize your Code Time vs. meetings in a single calendar. 

Linking your Code Time plugin to an email account helps ensure that you never lose access to your data (e.g. if you switch devices or need to reconnect). You can also connect multiple code editors on multiple devices using the same email account. 

If you click Not Now after installing Code Time, you can always create an account later by clicking on the status bar, then "Log in…"

**2. Track your progress during the day**

</p>

Your status bar shows you in real-time how many hours and minutes you code each day. After your first week, your status bar will show how you are trending vs. your average minutes for that day of the week over the last 90 days.

**3. Check out your Code Time dashboard**

At the end of your first day, click on Code Time in your status bar to open your dashboard. Your dashboard summarizes your data—such as your code time by project, lines of code, and keystrokes per minute—for today, yesterday, and last week. We also provide a summary over your last 90 days.

## Web app data visualizations
After you sign up for a web account via your editor, you can visit app.software.com to see more data visualizations. Here are a few examples of what you will see in your feed after your first week.

**Code Time heatmap**

Code Time measures your keystrokes per hour and summarizes your data in a weekly and 90-day average heatmap. Protect your best times on your heatmap from meetings and interrupts to help boost your productivity.

**Project-based reports**

See how much time you spend per project per week. Code Time also lets you set a rate per project and export your data to a CSV.

**Work-life balance**

How much do you code after hours and weekends? Code Time helps you see your breakdown at work vs. outside work so you can find ways to improve your work-life balance.
