## Time-tracking plugin for Visual Studio Code :paw_prints:

> **Code Time** is an open source plugin that provides programming metrics right in your code editor.

**In-editor dashboard**
Get daily and weekly reports of your programming activity right in your code editor.

**Status bar metrics**
After installing our plugin, your status bar will show real-time metrics about time coded per day.

**Weekly email reports**
Get a weekly report delivered right to your email inbox.

**Data visualizations**
Go to our web app to get simple data visualizations, such as a rolling heatmap of your best programming times by hour of the day.

**Calendar integration**
Integrate with Google Calendar to automatically set calendar events to protect your best programming times from meetings and interrupts.

## Why you should try it out

-   Automatic time reports by project
-   See what time you code your best—find your “flow”
-   Defend your best code times against meetings and interrupts
-   Find out what you can learn from your data

## It’s safe, secure, and free

**We never access your code**
We do not process, send, or store your proprietary code. We only track metrics about programming, and we make it easy to see the data we collect.

**Your data is private**
We will never share your individually identifiable data with your boss. In the future, we will roll up data into groups and teams (>5 developers) but we will keep your data anonymized.

**Free for you, forever**
We provide 90 days of data history for free, forever. In the future, we will provide premium plans for advanced features and historical data access.
